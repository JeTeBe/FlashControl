"# FlashControl"

This program is made for controlling a digital potentiometer from Renasas types X9C102, X9C103, X9C104, X9C503.

This is done by a lilygo t-diplay and a android tool call RoboRemoDemo.

The connection is Bluetooth serial.

My goal is to control a studio flash whereby the intensity is controlled by a potentiometer on the backside of the flash.
This potentiometer is replace by a digital one so I can control the intensity of the flash remote.

Goal in the future is to implement the NIKON speedflash protocol so the intensity is set automatic.
